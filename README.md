# Local Reads

# By TMT

## Introduction

LocalReads is a simple social network based around local libraries allowing users to see what other members of their community are reading and allows them to share books they have read with ratings and comments. 
 
Generating interest in local libraries, while allowing users to keep a log of the books they have read.


\[Local Reads\] aims to bring a social aspect back to your local library, allowing users to keep track of the books theyâ€™ve read and also allows them to share their thoughts with others.

LocalReads will be able to display all the libraries in Queens and display the books people have read and posted from that library, allowing users to see what books people are reading in their local community.

### Assets

All assets for the app icons can be [found here](images/Assets).


### Backend Services

The backend of the app is implmented in Firebase. 

* Registration and login uses Firebase's _Authentication_
* Structured data such as the pre-set list of categories, up- and down- votes use Firebase's _Database_
* Images are uploaded to Firebase's _Storage_

THIS IS MAGIC.

### Categories

For this MVP version of the app categories are defined and entered by an administrator 
within a node in the Firebase database and read into the app for use in any category 
related feature.

Users select among a pre-defined set of categories to  upload each image into. 
(Later versions of the app might allow the users to define the categories but this 
is not a current requirement.)

### Authentication

Registration and Login are reached from the same screen. Login is required in order to interact with voting and uploading.

### Profile

The profile page has a profile picture. This is chosen by tapping on the picture or a place-holder. 
The user is prompted to choose and upload a photo from the library. The user's up- and 	down- vote history
and a strip of your uploaded images, fetched from Firebase appear below the profile image.
 
### Uploads

##### Browsing

The Uploads tab is a custom photo browser built with the Photos framework. The data is
simply a reverse chronological list of all image assets in the user's library. Browsing is performed
by swiping either the main, large, image or the horizontally scrolling strip at bottom,
similar in operation to the built-in Photos app. Swiping above and scrolling below are kept in sync
with one another.

##### Uploading

When the user decides to upload an image, he/she chooses a category and gives it a title and
taps the upload button in the navigation bar. Progress and success (and failure) are reported.
