# Local Reads

# By TMT

## Introduction

Developed over a 2 day hackathon, LocalReads is a simple social network based around local libraries allowing users to see what other members of their community are reading and allows them to share books they have read with ratings and comments. 
 
We aim to generate interest in local libraries, while allowing users to keep a log of the books they have read.
